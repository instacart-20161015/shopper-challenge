INSTALLATION:

      1. edit the configuration in the instacart.py file or
         export an INSTACART_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. install the app from the root of the project directory

         pip install --editable .

      3. Instruct flask to use the right application

         export FLASK_APP=instacart

      4. initialize the database with this command:

         flask initdb

      5. now you can run instacart:

         flask run

         the application will greet you on
         http://localhost:5000/

NOTES:

Currently no my machine I am only able to get the application to work in Python3 (my typical env).  In Python2,
"flask run" fails because it cannot import "instacart".  Unfortunately I cannot say why this is happening.
If you have problems running the app, please contact me.

initdb will create 1,000,000 applications between 2012 ad 2014, with all permutations of application status
regarding quiz, onboarding, and hired state.

The project did not have any information about what quiz and onboarding are supposed to be, and unfortunately
my timing does not allow for me to ask questions (I have to do this over the weekend).  I created a db
schema to represent these items with no real data in them, just enough to represent their relations to
applications.

In creating all the permutations of the application records, I assumed that an applicant cannot be "hired"
unless they have completed onboarding and quiz.  From your sample data I saw indication that an applicant
can complete quiz and onboarding but not be "hired", so I allowed for this in the sample data.

Last, I am not a front end developer.  I have the basic skills and can create anything, but I do not
desire front end work and have not applied to do so.  Therefore I spent very little time trying to make
the GUI anything more than stable and functional.
